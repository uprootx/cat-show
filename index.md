# Ranks and Proficiencies

### Proficiency Badges
Earned based on command of skills and subject matter, in our culture Scouts must *maintain* the skillset

### Ranks

Elected positions of leadership, not an award, right, or title; it is a privilege, a responsibility and a mandate. A leader will only retain their authority as long as they retain the support of those who delegated that authority to them
